In order to collect more 'believable' images for the virtual players, we asked young people between the ages 18-25 from various ethnic backgrounds to take 3 pictures, each depicting a different facial expression. 

These were the instructions they were given: 

"Please take at least 3 photographs using your computer webcam. Ensure that the background is relatively simple, such as a bedroom, living room, or kitchen, and that no other people or identifiable information (student ID, passport, workplace logo etc.) are visible in the frame. In each photograph, please depict a neutral, happy, or threatening facial expression (ensuring the mouth is closed in all instancesâ€”i.e., smiling with a closed mouth). Maintain a comfortable posture as if you are engaged in a task on your computer. Feel free to send us multiple versions of each facial expression if you are uncertain about which ones are most appropriate."
