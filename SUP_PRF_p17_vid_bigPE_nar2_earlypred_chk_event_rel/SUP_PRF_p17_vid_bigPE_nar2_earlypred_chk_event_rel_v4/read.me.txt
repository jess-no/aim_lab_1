For this pilot, we originally wanted to have a counterbalanced block design (chocking vs no chocking). However, the experiment was coded in the wrong way. As a result the output file looked different than usual (i.e. we had repetitions of anxiety and mood ratings for example 2 anxiety or 2 mood ratings in the same trial). It was easier to extract the correct data manually and this is what we have done in the file named "CORRECT_SUP_PRF_p17_vid_bigPE_nar2_earlypred_chk_event_rel_v4_task_main". This is the file that we used in the analysis of pilot 17 data, as seen in "Surprise_study_pilot_17_EB.Rmd"
